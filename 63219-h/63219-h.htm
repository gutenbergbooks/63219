<h3 id="c3">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>This is presented as an aid in the identification of clay pipes from the general
area of Pamplin, Virginia, that might appear in archaeological and historic
sites. Interest in these pipes has been stimulated by their being reported as found
in various sites in the western United States.</p>
<p>The circumstances under which this information has been gathered and the
fact that it has been a number of years since clay pipes were made here, either as
a home industry or commercially by the Pamplin Smoking Pipe and Manufacturing
Company, leave much to be desired. On the other hand, in our work we
have inspected a total of 4,451 Pamplin pipes; of this number 39% were from
the factory grounds, and 61% were from the Thornton Store Site and represented
the home industry, so we feel that the 39 forms presented represent at least a
majority of the pipe forms made at Pamplin.</p>
<p>This is not to say that a similar form could not have been made elsewhere;
however the style, the generally heavier and thicker character of the piece, and
the finish, or lack of it, as well as the usual deep red color of the Virginia clay,
would seem to make these pipes distinctive.</p>
<p>Under the conditions in which these pipes were retrieved it is obvious that
the numbers of the different forms located give little indication of the relative
numbers of the different styles that were manufactured, the popularity of the
various styles, or the relative time of their manufacture.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the pipes examined were retrieved by excavation, by people
who simply happened to become interested; this is equally true whether the
pipes had been made by the factory and excavated out of fill on the old factory
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
grounds, or whether they were made at the homes and excavated from the basement
of the old Thornton Store, which through the years had taken them in
trade for merchandise.</p>
<p>In some cases among the pipes examined there were not more than one, or
a few, examples of a certain form. In other cases there were hundreds. Among
the examples available to us there was generally little variation in size within
the same form. We have illustrated the largest and the smallest, since this also
gives an opportunity to note minor variations that may exist between different
molds for the same pipe form. However, a rather wide variation in size was
present in that shown as (<a href="#fig13">Plate 13</a> A), the &ldquo;Original&rdquo; Powhatan, where a total
of 12 gradations from largest to smallest were found.</p>
<p>The predominant color of the pipes is dark red. A lighter color is infrequently
present, running from almost yellow, to salmon, to light brown. The
very dark, almost black coloration of some is said to come either from minerals
present in the soil of this area, to which the pipes presented here had been subjected
since nearly all had been many years underground, or from actual fire that
had fallen into the saggers of the Company kiln, or the iron pots in which the
pipes had been fired in the home industry.</p>
<p>During the last years of factory operation &ldquo;some white clay from either
West Virginia or Kentucky was shipped in by railroad&rdquo;. This resulted in pipes
of a lighter color, at times light grey to white. Apparently no pipes made from
this particular clay were seen by us, except possibly those illustrated in <a href="#fig23">Plate 23</a>
AJ.</p>
<h3 id="c4">THE HOME PIPEMAKING INDUSTRY</h3>
<p>Well established local tradition indicates that clay pipemaking in the homes,
for home and neighborhood use, started almost as soon as the first settlers reached
the area, and after the suitability of the local clay was discovered. Initial county
organization in this part of Virginia was well underway by the 1740&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Bradshaw&rsquo;s <i>History of Prince Edward County</i>, Virginia, 1955, p. 5 states, <i>Batho
Austin road to be cleared from the Appomattox River near Colonel Richard Randolph&rsquo;s
quarter to Hill&rsquo;s Fork on Vaughan&rsquo;s Creek by all who lived near the route and were
not employed on other roads. 1742.</i></p>
<p>Vernon C. Womack, Clerk of the Circuit Court, Prince Edward County, in
a personal letter states, &ldquo;Since the south fork of Vaughan&rsquo;s Creek originates a
short distance from where the pipe factory was later located in Pamplin, this
might be the starting point. John Wood&rsquo;s map of Prince Edward County, dated
1820 which shows that part that was later cut off to form Appomattox County,
gives a detail network of roads through Kelso&rsquo;s Old Store, which appears to be
near the present location of Pamplin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p><i>There were stores at Sandy River, Wm. and Samuel Matthew had a store at
Walker&rsquo;s Church, and Kelso&rsquo;s Old Store was between Walker&rsquo;s Church and Merriman&rsquo;s
Shop</i> (now Pamplin).&rdquo; The statement is footnoted <i>John Wood map</i>, 1820. (Bradshaw,
1955:319).</p>
<p><i>Merriman&rsquo;s Shop Post Office, 94 miles from Richmond, 185 miles from Washington.</i>
(Martin, 1835:269).</p>
<p><i>Advertisement for renewal of bids for rural route for port office in Merriman&rsquo;s
Shop in 1843-1848</i> (Bradshaw, 1955:315).</p>
<p>The area that was later to become Appomattox County had been, successively,
included in the areas of several earlier and larger counties. Appomattox
County was formed in 1845. The railroad came through Merriman&rsquo;s Shop in
1854, and was renamed Pamplin. The Appomattox County Courthouse burned
and the county records were destroyed by fire on February 2, 1892 (Communication
from Mrs. Aldah Gordon).</p>
<p>Mrs. Bess Franklin Mattox reported, &ldquo;Nicholas Pamplin, a resident of Merriman&rsquo;s
Shop, was the only citizen who permitted the railroad to go through
his land without charge and so the village was renamed for him&rdquo; (Mattox, personal
communication). For a time it was known as Pamplin Depot, then Pamplin
City, finally simply Pamplin.</p>
<p>The home manufacture of pipes has had a long history in this part of Virginia
and can be considered as well underway by the 1740s. It existed long before
the Company came to Pamplin and continued after the Company had ceased
operations, or as long as there was an active demand for clay pipes.</p>
<p>The Home Industry finally came to a close in 1953. &ldquo;Mrs. Betty Price of
Appomattox County was the last to make pipes. I have a mold used by her. She
made them from childhood and in her prime could make 40,000 pipes per year,
having been taught by her mother in 1866 when she was eight years old. Her
mother had made them a lifetime before her. In the last year of Mrs. Betty
Price&rsquo;s life, 1953, she made 500 pipes at the age of 95. They were made from
clay from her own farm.&rdquo; (Personal letter from Dr. Clyde G. O&rsquo;Brien of Appomattox,
and her son, Jack Price of Pamplin).</p>
<p>A column by the <i>News-Leader</i> correspondent from Appomattox, April 30,
(year unknown) said, <i>Hollywood bar reached all the way to Pamplin to get Mrs.
Betty Price&rsquo;s pipes for use by the Indians in the movie, &ldquo;Northwest Mounted Police&rdquo;.
Cecil B. DeMille&rsquo;s research man ferreted out the Powhatan pipe some months before the
film went into production. Several dozen were ordered. Frank Lloyd also bought pipes
to be used in the production of &ldquo;Howards of Virginia&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>Practically speaking, all of the pipes made at the homes were made by white
women, and from about the time of the first settlement of the territory, as the
special suitability of the local clay for that purpose was early discovered.</p>
<p>Miss Wilsie Thornton of Pamplin said that this industry had become especially
important after the War Between the States, because with so many men
having been killed and the area in such straitened circumstances, the women
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
were badly in need of some means of making a living. The pipes they made
could be traded at several general stores, or sold for a few cents, and there was
no cost for materials.</p>
<p>One such establishment at which the local women disposed of their pipes
was J. R. Franklin &amp; Co., of Pamplin. Some of these pipes were recovered when
the cargo of the sternwheeler, <i>Bertrand</i>, which sank in the Missouri River at
Port La Force, Nebraska, April 1, 1865, (Petsche, 1970:1) was salvaged in 1968-69.
The official list of artifacts recovered in the salvage operation, supplied by
Jerome E. Petsche, National Park Service, who was in charge of that operation
shows:</p>
<p><i>Pipes, Smoking; Several types and sizes recovered; briars and clay; one lot included
clay bowls exclusively, others contained stems and bowls. Consignee: Vivian and Simpson,
Virginia City. Manufacturer&rsquo;s stenciling</i>: &lsquo;THE CELEBRATED VIRGINIA
POWHATAN (CLAY), J. R. FRANKLIN &amp; CO., SOLE AGENTS FOR
THE MANUFACTURERS, PAMPLIN DEPOT, APPOMATTOX COUNTY,
VA.&rsquo; Field lot numbers MPC 104, MPC 358, FSC 171.</p>
<p>The following description of the pipe shipment on the <i>Bertrand</i> was provided
by Ronald R. Switzer, Director, Bertrand Conservation Laboratory, National
Park Service, Missouri Valley, Iowa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pipes are of one type and design (<a href="#fig2">Plate 2</a>). Forty pipe bowls plus 136
fragments ... all but 15 are chipped or broken, condition otherwise good. Clay,
predominantly grayish-tan, mottled with brick red and brown. Paste soft, fine,
and uniform, ... exterior has soft sheen. Preservation: Brushed with soft bristle
brush in running tap water to remove mud.&rdquo; (Switzer, personal communication).</p>
<p>This pipe is similar to (<a href="#fig19">Plate 19</a> U); however, there are slight variations due
to differences in individual molds made for production of the same pipe form.</p>
<p>The two pipe forms (<a href="#fig19">Plate 19</a> T &amp; U), were the only examples we found
that carried the peculiar pinkish-gray tan color, and they were found only among
the pipes made by the Home Industry. They were probably made of clay from
the same source and by the same individual, since home pipemakers usually dug
their clay on their own premises, and the condition of the pipes, after a century
in mud and moisture, indicates that the work was done well.</p>
<p>The shipment was contained in a wooden box, which was approximately
15&frac12; inches long, 8&frac12; inches wide, and 8 inches tall (<a href="#fig2">Plate 2</a>). The stenciling
on the box is faint, but legible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lettering on the top of the box indicated the consignee but is so faded
that it was impossible to obtain a good photograph; however the stencil once
read,&mdash;B. A. L. Vivian &amp; Simpson, Virginia City, M. T.&rdquo; (<a href="#fig3">Plate 3</a>) (Switzer,
personal communication).</p>
<p>&ldquo;One end of the box was lettered, No. 1, 216, M. Size&rdquo; (<a href="#fig3">Plate 3</a>). The
meaning of this can only be conjectured, however it may have indicated shipment
No. 1, to this consignee; containing 216 pipes; of Medium size.</p>
<p>The stencils identifying the consignor, J. R. Franklin &amp; Co., appeared on
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
both sides of the box and were identical (<a href="#fig3">Plate 3</a>). The same, except in abbreviated
form, appeared diagonally on one end of the box.</p>
<p>The account book of the store at New Store, Virginia, about 23 miles northeast
of Pamplin, which is in the collections at Appomattox Courthouse, records
that on Sept. 1, 1866, I. H. Schenault was paid $8.00 for 1,600 pipes, and later,
(apparently the same day) was paid $8.75 for 2,175 pipes. The latter was evidently
a partial and immediate &ldquo;in trade&rdquo; transaction.</p>
<p>So in the Pamplin area in the 1860s general stores were taking clay pipes
made in the home industry, allowing about &frac12;&cent; each in trade for commodities,
and at least in one instance were shipping them west for use by the miners in
the gold fields.</p>
<p>Mrs. Betty Price has said that the Powhatan &ldquo;Original&rdquo; (<a href="#fig13">Plate 13</a> A) the
&ldquo;Hamburg&rdquo; (<a href="#fig14">Plate 14</a> F) and the &ldquo;Zuvee&rdquo; or &ldquo;Zoo&rdquo;
(<a href="#fig19">Plate 19</a> T) were some of
the first pipe forms made in the area. (<i>News-Leader</i>, April 30, year unknown).</p>
<p>Many of the clay pipes made at homes near Pamplin were traded for commodities
at the Thornton General Store in Pamplin, and this store was truly
&ldquo;general&rdquo;, for it handled, in addition to groceries, everything from threshing
machines and horsepower mills to silk thread.</p>
<p>Miss Wilsie Thornton had a copy of her Father&rsquo;s letterhead: the letter was
dated, Jan. 9, 1892. The letterhead reads,&mdash;</p>
<p class="center"><i>W. D. THORNTON, DEALER.
<br />General Merchandise and Agricultural Implements.
<br />Wholesale dealer in All Styles of Clay Pipes and Stems
<br />Manufacturer&rsquo;s Agent for
<br />Aultman and Taylor Threshers, Horse Power and Farm Engines.
<br />Also Buckeye Reapers &amp; Mowers &amp; Thornmill Wagons.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;The pipes made by the local women,&rdquo; Miss Thompson said, &ldquo;were
traded to the Thornton Store for the necessities of life. The pipes were stored
in the basement of the store and packed in barrels, in either pine needles or sawdust,
and shipped to the Baltimore Bargain House, or to other wholesale houses.
From the wholesale houses they were shipped to the Cotton States and to the
West. Large orders were filled for a tobacco factory in Pennsylvania, where they
sold bags of tobacco with the pipes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pamplin pipes have been reported from the sites of Fort Laramie, Wyoming;
Fort Sanders, Wyoming; Fort Stambaugh, Wyoming; Fort Phil Kearny,
Wyoming; Fort Union, New Mexico; Fort Sully, South Dakota; and Fort Davis,
Texas (Wilson, 1971).</p>
<p>Miss Thornton&rsquo;s parents were married in 1874, but the store was already in
operation at that time. Her father continued operation until his death, December
16, 1897; after that the store was run by her brother. A bank, the &ldquo;Farmer&rsquo;s
and Merchant&rsquo;s National Bank&rdquo; was also operated in the store. In later years the
building became a drug store.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Finally with time and disuse the old building came down and erosion, with
perhaps some intentional filling of the area, took place. So the site of the old
general store, which in its heyday had meant so much to Pamplin and Appomattox
County and its people in their daily living, became simply a vacant area.</p>
<p>Some years ago Miss Thornton had made a train trip and met an old colored
woman in a rest room to which they had both gone to smoke. (When we met
her, Miss Thornton chain-smoked at the age of 89). The colored woman had a
sack of tobacco and pulled out a clay pipe which Miss Thornton recognized as
of the kind that her father used to take in trade, so she asked the woman if it
was a good one.</p>
<p>The woman answered, &ldquo;Law, yes, but I can&rsquo;t buy them any more!&rdquo; so Miss
Thornton told her that it was made long ago, in her home town, and that she
would try to get her some.</p>
<p>Her next problem was to find some pipes. After several days she thought of
the pipes that she felt sure were covered with earth and still in the basement of
her father&rsquo;s old store, so she talked to her cousin and next door neighbor, Mrs.
Bess Franklin Mattox.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, they dug at the site. Mrs. Mattox thinks it was around
1958, though possibly 2 years earlier. &ldquo;Erosion through the years had covered
the pipes and when we first started to dig we found none, then there they were,
under the dirt. We found two or three sugar barrels full. Tar was on a few of
the pipes, from road tar that was also stored in the basement and spilled&rdquo;. (This
tar, in hard-dried rough spots, is present on some of the pipes we examined;
however it chips off readily and leaves the pipe relatively clean).</p>
<p>So the colored woman who couldn&rsquo;t find a Pamplin pipe to buy received
&ldquo;either 15 or 16&rdquo; and Miss Thornton received a letter of thanks from her from
Atlanta.</p>
<p>Miss Thornton still had approximately 1,450 of the home manufactured
pipes for us to see when we visited her in July 1969, and Mrs. Mattox had a
few.</p>
<p>Dr. Clyde G. O&rsquo;Brien of Appomattox has had a lifelong interest in the clay
pipes of his area and in the history of their manufacture. He has a collection of
pipes as well as two pipe molds, and has given us much information.</p>
<h3 id="c5">HOME INDUSTRY PIPE MAKING METHODS</h3>
<p>We asked Dr. O&rsquo;Brien for an account of the method of making pipes in
the homes. The following is his contribution, in a letter dated March 11, 1971.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I talked to Jack Price, age 86, he had worked in the plant for years. His
mother, Mrs. Betty Price, and grandmother made pipes at home in Pamplin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The clay was made up and put into molds, when the pipe was removed
from the mold the shaper was used to smooth mold marks, if the pipe was to
be identified with &lsquo;Original&rsquo;, &lsquo;Hayiti&rsquo;, or some other marking this was impressed
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
on the base with a stamp at this time. The pipe was then sun-dried on a board
in summer, or in the stove oven in winter. Then after they had &lsquo;set-up&rsquo; the pipes
were put into an iron pot, the pots were put into an oven in the back yard and
dry chestnut wood was placed around the pots and this was then set on fire.
They did not have a thermometer so he did not know the temperature, but
when the wood had burned completely the pipes were brought out to cool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a piece of wood fell into the burning pot and started to smoke it was
removed at once to keep from blackening or staining the pipes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the pipes cooled they were brought into the house and Mr. Price
said that when the pipes were poured out of the pot in which they were baked,
to the floor, they would ring or chime when they hit against each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pipes were then waxed with bee&rsquo;s wax and mutton tallow and then
polished with a woolen cloth, and the children helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all of this, Bob Davis of Pamplin, age 91, in talking to John W. Walker in
1962, had concurred. He said, &ldquo;The pipes were molded, trimmed, put on a board
and dried in the sun, baked in iron pots, waxed, and rubbed. The pipes were made
all through the country, the local stores bought and shipped them, and the
Factory would buy these &lsquo;country pipes&rsquo;.&rdquo; Here was more direct evidence that
the Factory, on occasion at least, bought and shipped pipes made by the Home
Industry (Walker, personal communication).</p>
<p>There were, however, two men who made pipes.</p>
<p>Dr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s father Thomas O&rsquo;Brien, was born in 1843. When he came
back after the War, about 1865, he made his own mold of white-oak with lead
lining and made pipes for his own use.</p>
<p>According to Miss Wilsie Thornton, a Mr. Rodgers was making molds and
pipes until about 1938 as a hobby. One of them was in the form of an Indian
head (<a href="#fig23">Plate 23</a> AL). The &ldquo;peach seed&rdquo; pipe (<a href="#fig23">Plate 23</a> AM) is also thought to
be one of his manufacture.</p>
<h3 id="c6">THE PAMPLIN SMOKING PIPE AND MANUFACTURING COMPANY</h3>
<p>In the middle 1850&rsquo;s that part of Ohio that surrounds Akron was the pipemaking
capital of the United States, with at least six clay products companies
producing them (Blair, 1965:26-30). The leading producer of clay smoking pipes
in the Akron vicinity was the E. H. Merrill Co., which had been producing pottery
objects since its founding in 1831. In 1843 or 1844 Calvin, brother of E. H. Merrill,
invented a machine for making pipes which greatly increased the output of the
company and gave quite an advantage over its competitors (Blair, 1965:3).</p>
<p>The Pamplin Smoking Pipe and Manufacturing Company, Inc., was established
by the Akron Smoking Pipe Company of Akron, Ohio, when they built
the plant at Pamplin.</p>
<p>That the clay in Appomattox County was well suited to pipe manufacture
was well known. The establishment of this plant was no doubt the result of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Company&rsquo;s realization of the availability of the fine red clay from which the local
women were producing pipes, a clay that could be used without even sifting.</p>
<p>When the Pamplin Factory was established is quite uncertain. Examination
of the microfilm of newspapers of the area that were available from the Virginia
State Library, beginning February 3, 1869 through December 25, 1896, gave no
clue to the date of the establishment of the Pamplin Factory, nor did county
records, probably due to the fire of 1892.</p>
<p><i>Sometime immediately prior to 1880 William Merrill of Akron, Ohio, undoubtedly
a member of the pipe making family, established a pipe making factory at Pamplin.</i>
(Omwake, 1967:23). Our Pamplin informants were of the opinion that the Akron
plant was devoted to the manufacture of drain tile after the pipe machinery
was moved to Pamplin.</p>
<p>Bob Davis of Pamplin, born 1871, in an interview with John W. Walker in
September 1962, said, &ldquo;I was a kid when the factory came in&rdquo;. Timewise this
would be in general agreement with Omwake&rsquo;s estimate for the date of the establishment
of the factory at Pamplin.</p>
<p>That Pamplin pipes were also available from Akron in 1893 is evidenced by
a letterhead of the Akron Smoking Pipe Company, dated June 26, 1893, showing
examples of two clay pipes similar to <a href="#fig22">Plate 22</a> AF &amp; AG, (Blair, 1965:36).
A communication from the Summit County Historical Society reports, &ldquo;The
Akron Smoking Pipe Co. is recorded as being in business from 1891 to 1895,
and were manufacturers of stone, Powhatan Clay, and corn cob tobacco pipes.
Daily capacity 100,000 pipes. General offices, Akron, Ohio. Factories, Pamplin
City, Virginia; Mogadore, Ohio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Statements in company literature are also confusing. In a leaflet which carries
a testimonial for their pipes, dated April 28, 1941 and price lists &ldquo;effective
November 15, 1941&rdquo;, the statement is made, <i>from careful search of the records, this
factory started more than 200 years ago ... the present plant has been in operation for
44 years. Skilled American labor is used in a modern, day-lit plant with special attention
to cleanliness, sanitation, and ideal working conditions</i> (<a href="#fig8">Plate 8</a>).</p>
<p>This would give a date for the &ldquo;present plant&rdquo; of 1897, but it also suggests
that an earlier plant had been rebuilt or replaced. (An undated and unidentified
news clipping does state that at some time the pipe plant had burned). Company
literature also states, &ldquo;Established 1739&rdquo; (<a href="#fig8">Plate 8</a>). This obviously cannot
refer to the establishment of the plant, nor even to the mother plant at Akron,
since pottery was first produced in Summit County, Ohio, in 1828 (Blair, 1965:2).
The Company may simply have been employing &ldquo;poet&rsquo;s license&rdquo; and appropriated
a date which they felt representative of the start of the Home Pipe Making
Industry in the Pamplin area.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>The <i>Times-Virginian</i> of Appomattox, date unknown, carried a news article,
<i>Pamplin Clay Pipe Plant once termed largest in the World</i>. The <i>Farmville Herald</i> of
March 29, 1935 stated, ... <i>the output of the Clay Pipe Factory at Pamplin is 1,000,000
a month, when it is running full time. In the roster of business in Virginia, this factory
is mentioned as the largest clay pipe factory in the United States, and so far as is
known, in the world.</i></p>
<p>At one point in the history of the plant, pipes were sold to England as well
as some other countries in Europe.</p>
<p>Also vague has been the terminal date of the Pamplin Company; it is variously
given locally as 1948 to 1951.</p>
<p>There is a contemporary news article on the factory published in the <i>Richmond
Times-Dispatch</i>, April 21, 1946. <i>A History of Appomattox, Virginia</i>, published
1948, states, <i>The Akron Pipe Factory of Pamplin holds the title of manufacturing the
finest clay smoking pipes in the world, known as the &lsquo;Powhatan&rsquo;</i> (Featherstone, 1948:44).</p>
<p>In a personal letter to the writers, John C. Ewers said, &ldquo;During my field
work on the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana, in 1953, I first learned of the
Pamplin clay pipes. One of my Indian informants told me about selling them
when he was working at a trading post on the reservation during the first decade
of the present century....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later I visited the trading post at Oswego on the Fort Peck Reservation.
There the proprietor showed me the illustrated price list of the Pamplin Smoking
Pipe and Manufacturing Company, Inc. He showed me the only type of pipe
he still had in stock&mdash;the &lsquo;Century of Progress&rsquo;, Chicago type (<a href="#fig23">Plate 23</a> AJ). He
said the manufacturer wrote him in 1951 that he planned to go back into the
manufacture of the other styles, which the Assiniboine preferred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tomahawk pipe was a good specialty item for sale at such events as
fairs and expositions, and the Company&rsquo;s sales to the &ldquo;Century of Progress&rdquo; in
Chicago in 1933 must have been excellent, even though they had not sold all
they had made in anticipation of that demand. The bowl, necessarily narrow and
elongated since it was in the blade of the tomahawk, did not recommend it to
serious smokers, nor to the Assiniboine.</p>
<p>It would seem evident that these pipes were left over from the production
of the Company in 1933, that their regular pipe models had by this time been
sold out, and that the Company was already in a State of quiescence in 1951.</p>
<p>Dr. Clyde G. O&rsquo;Brien of Appomattox stated that the Company ceased operations
in 1951.</p>
<p>The Charter of the Pamplin Smoking Pipe and Manufacturing Company
shows that it was incorporated by the Commonwealth of Virginia on the 15th
day of August, 1929. The officers at that time were, J. V. Lewis, Pres., Prospect,
Virginia; J. W. Franklin, V.Pres., Pamplin; L. N. Ligon, V.Pres., Pamplin; T. R.
Pugh, Secy-Treas., Pamplin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>The purposes of the Company then were, among other things, to deal in
wood of all kinds, own timber lands, contract to do construction work, deal in
real estate, <i>and to buy and sell all kinds of necessary material ... and operate all the
necessary equipment and machinery for the purpose of manufacturing clay pipes, crocks,
and earthenware</i>.... (Charter Book No. 1, Page 108, Appomattox County, Virginia).
The corporation (Charter No. 34565-16) was dissolved by the State Corporation
Commission, at the request of the stockholders, on February 21, 1952.</p>
<p>A personal communication, February 23, 1972, from Morton L. Wallerstein
who with Ralph L. Dombrower as corporate officers were the last active operators
of the pipe factory, states, &ldquo;Mr. Dombrower and myself, as sole stockholders,
started the operation in 1938 and baked the clay pipes up to the time of the
enactment of the Minimum Wage Law by Congress. At that time it was apparent
that the part-time workers, largely farm girls and boys who worked in the
afternoon, would cease to be employed because the pipes could not be marketed
under the wages required to be paid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, Mrs. Betty Price and another woman made the hand-made clay
pipes at their homes, which pipes Mr. Dombrower bought after 1938 and very
cleverly boxed in antique fashion and sold them for some years. However, unfortunately
the women who made these pipes died and they were no longer
made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The factory, itself, did not manufacture pipes beyond the period stated
above. The property was sold in 1947 and the corporation was dissolved in 1952.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently then, the Pamplin Smoking Pipe and Manufacturing Company
ceased all activity in 1951, having been in existence slightly more than 70 years.</p>
<p>Some time after the closing, the main factory building was used as a garage.
In July of 1969 this frame building, with the name &ldquo;Pamplin Smoking Pipe and
Manufacturing Co., Inc., American Indian Clay Smoking Pipes&rdquo; still painted
above the entrance, stood unoccupied; the crumbling old smokestack and large
round kiln of brick construction were still there (Plates <a href="#fig4">4</a> &amp; <a href="#fig5">5</a>). Another building
which had served Company purposes had been destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="c7">FACTORY MACHINERY</h3>
<p>The machinery to mold smoking pipes and bottles was invented by Calvin
J. Merrill of the E. H. Merrill Pottery, Summit County, Ohio, in 1843 (Blair,
1965:3).</p>
<p>The pipe machine was simple: the individual metal molds in the foot powered
mechanism could be changed to vary the pipe form. The whole was contained
in a simple wooden bench (<a href="#fig6">Plate 6</a>). Miss Wilsie Thornton felt that a
man working such a machine could produce thousands of pipes per day. It is
unknown how many such machines were used by the factory, nor how many
people were employed since ideas of our informants varied; however, the best
estimate seems to be 8 to 10 machines, with employees varying from 10 to 40,
depending upon the press of work and the rush of orders at any given time.</p>
<p>Bob Davis of Pamplin, in the interview with John W. Walker said, &ldquo;Old
man Taz Harvey made the Powhatan mold. He had a shop and made many
molds&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h3 id="c8">FACTORY FIRING AND GLAZING</h3>
<p>The pipes were packed in round stoneware crocks or saggers made from
fireclay, and the saggers were stacked alternately around the kiln. The saggers
were some eight inches high and 16 to 18 inches in diameter (<a href="#fig7">Plate 7</a>). There
was an opening in the top of the kiln through which, in glazing, salt was put
when the pipes were hot. They were fired some 24 or 48 hours (Miss Thornton&rsquo;s
statement).</p>
<p>Mrs. Maddox said: &ldquo;As a child I used to go with a colored man who worked
with us and also for the factory, and watch him throw salt down a hole in the
top of the kiln on the pipes to make a glaze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a high temperature the salt vaporized and combined with the silica in
the body of the clay to form a glassy or &lsquo;silicate glaze&rsquo;. The kiln was fired 32 to
36 hours before maximum temperature was reached; it was cooled the same period
to prevent crazing (minute cracking) of the glaze (Blair, 1965:15). This description
of glazing refers to stoneware in the mid-nineteenth century potteries
near Akron, Ohio. However since the Pamplin kiln was the same sort of &ldquo;walk-in&rdquo;
kiln, the detail would fit, and it is substantiated by Miss Thornton&rsquo;s statement
of firing time.</p>
<p>From the scarcity of glazed pipes among the many that we examined, we
conclude that the majority were finished without glazing.</p>
<h3 id="c9">REED STEMS</h3>
<p>The stems sold with the factory pipes were made from switch cane <i>Arundinara
gigantea</i> known locally as reed and once abundant in the Great Dismal
Swamp in southeastern Virginia (R. H. Woodling to Chas. H. Meadows, May
15, 1969). (The stems used with the pipes made by the Home Industry usually
came from the same source.)</p>
<p>The reeds were cut in 12 foot lengths by men in boats, allowed to dry for
six months, cut in lengths and reamed out. Some were put in a machine and
bent (Miss Thornton, Dr. O&rsquo;Brien).</p>
<p>Cork plugs or washers were used in the base of the pipes to hold the stem
in place. Some were still in place in pipes we examined. A plug mill, a high
pressure machine, extruded the cork plugs which were cut off by wire (Heite).</p>
<p>(Replacement reed stems for clay, hickory, or corn cob pipes, retailed in the
grocery stores in Lexington, Missouri, for 10&cent; per dozen about 1916).</p>
<h3 id="c10">PIPES MADE BY THE FACTORY</h3>
<p>A number of people and institutions with varying numbers of Pamplin Factory
pipes in their possession have given us an opportunity to examine them.
The largest number of specimens were in the hands of the following.</p>
<p>Our attention was first called to these pipes in 1968 at the Craft Club in
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Arrow Rock, Missouri, where some of them appeared for sale as an unusual
item. They obviously had been underground, for the bowls and bases were still
filled with earth containing numerous rootlets growing through the pipe cavities.</p>
<p>It was learned that the pipes had been supplied by Francis B. Fitzgerald,
Suffolk, Virginia; David I. Dautenhahn, Marshall, Missouri, put us in touch
with him. As a youngster, Fitzgerald had on various occasions visited his grandfather&rsquo;s
farm, which was near the Pamplin Factory, and had played in the water
of a little creek on pipe plant property. In so doing, he discovered that there
were numerous clay pipes in a bank which apparently had been placed in the
creek to form a dam. (The dam was probably for the purpose of retaining water
to mix with the clay). He had hundreds of these pipes. Practically none would
seem to have been rejects&mdash;how or why they got into the dirt which was used
to make the fill is unknown. Through the years Fitzgerald had made a selection
of forms representative of this group, all of which he made available to us.</p>
<p>Since that time an owner of the pipe plant property had secured many pipes,
later acquired by the Appomattox National Historic Park. They were made available
to us by Alford L. Rechtor, Superintendent.</p>
<p>The Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission supplied photographs of
some Pamplin pipes, as well as photographs of a pipe mold and pipe maker&rsquo;s
bench (<a href="#fig6">Plate 6</a>) and saggers (<a href="#fig7">Plate 7</a>). We were granted the use of these by Edward
F. Heite and Edward A. Chappell of that institution.</p>
<p>John W. Walker of the National Park Service, who had worked in the area
and become interested in the pipes made there, provided us with a copy of his
field notes and some examples of pipes.</p>
<p>John C. Ewers of the Smithsonian Institution had visited Pamplin. He gave
us much information and showed us several pipe forms from the area that are
in the collections of that institution.</p>
<p>Rex L. Wilson, National Park Service, loaned us a copy of his manuscript,
&ldquo;Clay Tobacco Pipes from Fort Laramie, Wyoming and Related Sites&rdquo;, in which
he identified some specimens as having come from Pamplin.</p>
<h3 id="c11">FACTORY PRICE LIST OF PIPES AND JOBBERS DISCOUNTS, AS OF 1941.</h3>
<p>The Company&rsquo;s price list of November 1941 listed &ldquo;The Powhatan Machine
Made&rdquo;, fitted with cork closures and 10&Prime; reed stems, bowls trade-marked,
packed 50 to box, 25&cent; retailer. Price $6.00 per box.&rdquo; (<a href="#fig10">Plate 10</a>).</p>
<p>Five other models were listed, &ldquo;5 in. reed stems, packed 100 to box, 15&cent;
retailer. Price $3.00 per box.&rdquo; Two models were listed similarly, but 10&cent; retailers,
price $2.50 per box. Two other 10&cent; retailers were listed at $2.70 per box, and
one model at $2.85 per box but the suggested retail price was still 10&cent; each.</p>
<p>One model, their &ldquo;Ole Virginny Hamburg&rdquo;, was offered in finest fire-clay,
hard-burned, white, simulates meerschaum, also in red. Similar to &ldquo;Ole Virginny
Shaker&rdquo;. It was a 10&cent; retailer, $2.70 per box of 100. (It is of interest that this
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
pipe, listed elsewhere in this same price list, but as &ldquo;Ole Virginny Shaker of
Virginia red clay, a heavier stone pipe&rdquo;, was priced as a 15&cent; retailer and $3.00
per box). (<a href="#fig10">Plate 10</a>).</p>
<p>Jobbers discounts were offered. &ldquo;10 to 20 boxes, 20%&rdquo;, and going up by 5%
stages to &ldquo;101 to 500 boxes, 35% discount&rdquo;. &ldquo;We make many other styles of
Indian Clay and Stone Pipes, ... we can make any style of pipe that can be made
of clay. Our own designers and artists are at your service&rdquo; (<a href="#fig11">Plate 11</a>).</p>
<p>In the last years of Factory operation their sales carried an identification tag,
&ldquo;This Is An &lsquo;Original&rsquo; Powhatan Pipe&rdquo;, and it was being made by the last two
women of the Pamplin area who were still making pipes at their homes (<a href="#fig12">Plate 12</a>).</p>
<h3 id="c12">PAMPLIN AREA PIPE FORMS</h3>
<p>The pipes are illustrated natural size. The largest and the smallest pipe of
each form available to us are shown. In many instances this difference in size
is not great; however, it does illustrate that minor variations often existed in
different molds for the same pipe form. The diameters for the stem openings
have not been included since they have proved useful only in consideration of
the earlier integral-stem clays, and not for consideration of the &ldquo;short-base&rdquo; pipes
of the type and time included in this report (Wilson, 1971:2).</p>

<p><i><a href="#fig13">Plate 13</a> A.</i> Slightly Acute Angle. Made <i>both</i> in the factory and in the home.
Many examples. All are a deep, dark, glossy red, except 9 pipes which were a
light brown. Plain round bowl, octagonal base. It was made in at least 12 slightly
varying sizes, there being that many variations between the large and the
small pipe illustrated. This was the Pamplin Company&rsquo;s &ldquo;Original&rdquo; Powhatan,
and it was no doubt one of the Company&rsquo;s leaders in production and sales. The
word &ldquo;ORIGINAL&rdquo; is impressed in the right side of each base, with the exception
of one single pipe, and the lettering appears in at least three different sizes,
there being no correlation between the letter size and pipe size. This is a sturdily
made pipe.</p>
<p>The Company emphasized in its publicity that the Indians had originally
demonstrated to the early settlers the method of making the Powhatan and so
had enabled them to make this exact form, thereby inferring that this model
should have been of particular interest and worth. No doubt at some time and
place in our history a happening of this nature may have occurred. However,
the Powhatan is a usual form which has been found in aboriginal sites, with
some modifications and of varying materials, over a wide area.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Many of these pipes appeared, both from the factory site and among those
made by local women and retrieved from the basement of the Thornton General
Store. Mrs. Betty Price said that this form was a standard product of the local
Home Industry pipe makers before the factory ever came to Pamplin and one of
the earliest made in the area. All of the pipes available to us carried the designation
&ldquo;Original&rdquo; except one.</p>
<p>The making of clay pipes was an old and well established business at Pamplin;
whether the impressing of the word ORIGINAL on the base of this pipe
was an innovation of the Pamplin Smoking Pipe and Manufacturing Company,
or whether this had been long done by the Home Industry is unknown.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig31">Plate 13</a> B.</i> Slightly Acute Angle. Home. 2 examples. Dark red. Plain round
bowl, octagonal base. Quite similar to &ldquo;A&rdquo; except both bowl and base are shorter,
and diameter of bowl proportionally larger. &ldquo;ORIGINAL&rdquo; is impressed on
right side of base. A very sturdy pipe.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig13">Plate 13</a> C.</i> Slightly Acute Angle. Home. 11 examples. Glossy dark red.
Round bowl, octagonal base. Upper part of bowl plain, lower front portion decorated
with a series of raised dots. The dotted area is divided into two triangles,
as well as separated from the undecorated area by raised and rounded bands. The
mold marks in the undecorated area have been almost entirely smoothed. It
would seem that all pipes of this form came from the same mold, in contrast to
the fact that at least most other Pamplin pipe forms seem to have come from a
number of different molds.</p>
<p>The two pipe forms &ldquo;C&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; are quite similar, except that &ldquo;C&rdquo; has
decoration as well as a slightly longer base, and is not marked &ldquo;Original&rdquo; Both
are sturdily built, with thicker than average bowl walls, and both were retrieved
from the Thornton Store site; no examples were found at the factory site. They
are probably the product of the same individual woman working at her home.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig14">Plate 14</a> D.</i> Slightly Acute Angle. Home. 4 examples. This is a black pipe.
The deep, solid color was probably intentionally achieved by allowing portions
of the burning wood of the kiln to fall into the iron kettles which were used
as saggers for the firing of pipes in the Home Industry. The bowl and base are
round, with diagonal cross-hatched decoration on bowl, separated from the same
decoration on remainder of base by a narrow rounded band. Flat band at both
top of bowl and end of base. The right and left halves of the pipe are separated
from each other, front and back, by a broad smooth ridge covering the mold
mark.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig14">Plate 14</a> E.</i> Slightly Acute Angle. Home. Many examples. Bright red. Bowl
and base decoration similar to &ldquo;D&rdquo;, but this form is somewhat smaller than
&ldquo;D&rdquo;. Double band at both top of bowl and end of base, the outside band broad
and flat, inside band narrow and rounded. Only slight variations in size.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig14">Plate 14</a> F.</i> Right Angle. Both. Many examples. Dull red. The Company
called this their &ldquo;Akron Hamburg&rdquo;. The diagonally cross-hatched bowl decoration
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
is separated from the diagonal line base decoration by a rounded band. Double
band at both top of bowl and end of base, the outside band broad and flat,
the inside band narrow and rounded. The right and left halves of the pipe are
divided from each other, front and back, by a broad smooth ridge covering the
mold mark. Only slight variations in size.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig15">Plate 15</a> G.</i> Right Angle. Factory. Many examples. Dull red. Diagonal line
decoration on bowl runs at right angles to that on base. Double band at top of
bowl and stem end of base, outside band flat, inside band narrower and rounded.
The right and left halves of the pipe are divided from each other, front and
back, by a broad smooth ridge which covers the mold mark. Two slightly different
sizes.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig15">Plate 15</a> H.</i> Acute Angle. Home. 3 examples. Dull, dark red. Spiral decoration
on bowl, plain hexagonal base. Double band at top of bowl, upper flat,
lower rounded. Large rounded band at end of base.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig15">Plate 15</a> I.</i> Right Angle. Factory. Many examples. Dull, dark red; a few are
light brown. The Company called this model their &ldquo;Ole Virginny Shaker&rdquo;.
Grooves of decoration run vertically on bowl and curve toward the bottom to
stop at a rounded band, then continue horizontally to stem end of base. Double
band at top of bowl, upper flat, lower rounded. Double band at stem end of
base, inside band rounded; the outside band may be either rounded or flat; if flat,
the end of base is noticeably swelled. Five slightly varying sizes.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig16">Plate 16</a> J.</i> Sharply acute Angle. Factory. Many examples. Dark red. Broad
grooves of decoration run from top of bowl and curve toward bottom to continue
to stem end of base, or curve back around bowl. Double band at top of
bowl, upper flat, lower rounded. Prominent rounded swell at stem end of base.
At least 4 different sizes.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig16">Plate 16</a> K.</i> Acute Angle. Both. Many examples. Dull red to dark brown.
Quite similar to &ldquo;J&rdquo; in form and decoration except that lines of decoration are
more narrow and the bowl does not set at such an acute angle to base. Only
slight variations in size.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig16">Plate 16</a> L.</i> Obtuse Angle. Factory. Many examples. Dark red to brown.
Round undecorated bowl and round tapering base. These pipes are somewhat
similar to early stemmed clay imports except that the base is cut off rather short,
to form a flat vertical face, instead of terminating in a stem which was an integral
part of the bowl and base. The opening in the end of the base is quite small and
does not have the usual taper. All of the pipes of this form are nearly identical
in size.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig17">Plate 17</a> M.</i> Acute Angle. Both Home and Factory products, 37 examples.
Bright, light red. Plain round bowl, hexagonal base expanding to a bell-shaped
swell at stem end of base. The flat bottom extends around and under the bowl.
&ldquo;ORIGINAL&rdquo; is impressed in the right side of base of some examples and
&ldquo;FLORENCE&rdquo; in others, while some have no wording. The factory examples
that we saw were marked either &ldquo;ORIGINAL&rdquo; or &ldquo;FLORENCE&rdquo;, as were some
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
of those of home manufacture; however, 16 pipes of home manufacture had no
wording. At least three sizes are represented.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig17">Plate 17</a> N.</i> Acute Angle. Factory. One Example. Dull, dark red. Similar to
&ldquo;M&rdquo; except heavy rounded band of beading around near top of bowl, no wording.
Hexagonal base expands to a bell-shaped swell at stem end. Mold marks
are more distinct.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig17">Plate 17</a> O.</i> Acute Angle. Factory. One example. Dull, dark red. Plain octagonal
bowl, with planes continuing along base to large rounded swell at stem
end. From deep in the dam at factory site.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig17">Plate 17</a> P.</i> Obtuse Angle. Both Home and Factory. Many examples. Dull,
dark red or brown. Octagonal bowl and base. No decoration. Base expands
slightly towards stem end. Relatively small pipe, three slightly varying sizes.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig18">Plate 18</a> Q.</i> Obtuse Angle. Both Home and Factory. Many examples. Glossy,
light red to deep red. Plain round bowl and base: the base terminates in rounded
and swelled end. &ldquo;Hayiti&rdquo; impressed on right side of base. At least three sizes
of lettering. A few of these pipes are right angled. A similar pipe, except that it
had one small rounded band of beading near the top of bowl, the Company
called theirs &ldquo;Powow Smooth Shaker&rdquo;.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig18">Plate 18</a> R.</i> Very Acute Angle. Home. 10 examples. Dark, glossy red. &ldquo;Genuine&rdquo;
is impressed on the right side of base, except one example which had no
lettering. Plain round bowl and base, terminating in rounded and swelled base
end. All apparently from same mold except one which was not marked &ldquo;Genuine&rdquo;.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig18">Plate 18</a> S.</i> Acute Angle. Both Home and Factory. Many examples. Glossy,
dark red. Plain hexagonal bowl which expands towards the bottom. Plain, slim
round base tapering towards stem end. These pipes usually carry a high glossy
finish. Two slightly different sizes.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig19">Plate 19</a> T.</i> Slightly Acute Angle. Home. Fourteen examples. Uniform light
tan color. Undecorated round bowl and base. Bowl tapers uniformly from top to
bottom and base expands uniformly to stem end. Two slightly varying sizes. No
mold marks, but some evidence of smoothing.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig19">Plate 19</a> U.</i> Right Angle. Home. Two examples. Uniform, light pinkish tan
color. Quite similar to &ldquo;T&rdquo; except bowl diameter is slightly larger and does not
have the extreme taper, but rounds towards the base. Two slightly varying sizes.
Probably made of the same clay by the same person who made &ldquo;T&rdquo;. No evidence
of mold marks, but some evidence of smoothing.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig19">Plate 19</a> V.</i> Acute Angle. Factory. One example. Dull red. Round bowl and
base. Two bands of rounded beading encircle mid-portion of bowl, base expands
towards stem end. &ldquo;117&rdquo; in raised figures appears on the left side of the base
near stem end.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig19">Plate 19</a> W.</i> Right Angle (A Surface find). One example. Dull red. Except
for its angle, this pipe is quite similar to &ldquo;V&rdquo; with its two bands of rounded
beading encircling the bowl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p><i><a href="#fig20">Plate 20</a> X.</i> Slightly Acute Angle. Factory. One example. Salmon pink color.
Ten-sided bowl and base. A rounded band of beading is near the top of bowl,
the base end is simply cut off flat.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig20">Plate 20</a> Y.</i> Acute Angle. Both Home and Factory. Two examples. The bowl is
decorated by narrow upright grooves and ridges which extend from the base up to
and lightly across a rounded band which encircles the bowl near its top. The
hexagonal base flares somewhat toward the stem end. This the Company called
&ldquo;Wigwam Shaker&rdquo;.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig20">Plate 20</a> Z.</i> Acute Angle. Factory. Four examples. Color ranges from pale
red to light orange, though two are very dark, probably from having lain long in
the stream bed. The round bowl is encircled by a band of rounded beading near
the top. Below this, on each side of the bowl, appears &ldquo;CATLINS&rdquo;. The base
is hexagonal and its planes merge into the lower portions of the round bowl.
The top plane of the base seems to be divided into two narrower planes which
give the base a seven-sided appearance; this however is probably due to lack of
trimming of the mold mark. The base terminates in a large rounded stem end.
This was probably a specialty pipe, and apparently all the pipes of this form had
these characteristics.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig20">Plate 20</a> AA.</i> Acute Angle. Factory. Four examples. Color ranges from pale
red to light orange to medium red. The 14 upright panels which constitute
the bowl, with its two encircling rounded bands near the top, give the effect of
a wooden bucket whose staves are held by hoops. The raised number &ldquo;103&rdquo; appears
on the flat bottom. In one example a metal ferrule, apparently of brass, is
still in place around the stem end of base. Other examples of this pipe no longer
retain the ferrule; however, the discolored pattern of the ferrule was present
to show that each had originally had one in place. All pipes of this form seem
identical and evidently came from the same mold.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig21">Plate 21</a> AB.</i> Right Angle. Factory. One example. Dark Red. Round undecorated
bowl and base. Stem end of base has an inside taper to hold a small reed
stem.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig21">Plate 21</a> AC.</i> Slight Obtuse Angle. Home. One example. Glossy, dark red.
Similar to &ldquo;AB&rdquo; except the angle of bowl and &ldquo;ORIGINAL&rdquo; is impressed on
the right side of the longer base.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig21">Plate 21</a> AD.</i> Obtuse Angle. Factory. One example. The plain bowl and
base have a uniform high glossy red finish. &ldquo;POWHATAN&rdquo; is impressed on
the right side of base. The stem end of base has been broken off, and it is possible
that this base terminated in a clay stem which was an integral part of the
pipe. In that event it would have followed the pattern of some of the old white
clay imports. There are no spurs or projections of any nature at the bottom of
the bowl.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig21">Plate 21</a> AE.</i> Probably Obtuse Angle. Factory. One example. Glossy medium
red. This is a form similar to some early white clay imports. While the only
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
example available to us was badly broken, it seems to have its own integral clay
stem, and it definitely has one spur below the bowl.</p>
<p><i>Roll of Fired Clay.</i> A portion of a roll of fired clay was found in the fill on
the Factory site. It evidently had been prepared for molding, and some clay had
been broken from each end. It could have been a test firing of the clay, or the
piece may have unintentionally gotten into the kiln.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig22">Plate 22</a> AF.</i> Right Angle. Factory. Two examples. Colors are light orange
and red. A flat band encircles the top of the bowl, and below this is a more narrow
rounded band, whose lower edge is here and there lightly cut in line with
the grooves below. The vertical grooves of decoration on the bowl continue, or
merge with a lesser number of horizontal grooves and ridges which run to the
stem end of the base. These grooves, in part at least, extend over the large
rounded swell at stem end of base. These two pipes illustrate the minor differences
that may exist in different molds used in making the same basic pipe form.</p>
<p>This and the following three pipe forms seem to represent a transition from
the earlier, rather heavy, sturdy and relatively thick side-walled clay pipes, to a
pipe lighter in weight, which is more representative of the form in use by what
might be considered the last generation of regular clay pipe smokers.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig22">Plate 22</a> AG.</i> Acute Angle. Factory. One example. Color is gray. This piece was
among the eight pipe sherds, still sufficiently intact to give an indication of the
original pipe form from which they had come, that were picked up by us on the
driveway of the Pamplin Smoking Pipe and Manufacturing Company in July
1969. Some were heavily glazed and of a different character from the pipes dealt
with up to this point, and seem to have come from pipes resulting from the
change in style mentioned under &ldquo;AF&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This pipe fragment has some characteristics similar to &ldquo;AF&rdquo;. The bowl decoration
towards the top is unknown, but vertical lines of decoration occupy the
bowl, and only those on the front of the bowl continue along the base; those
on the sides terminate upon joining the front lines. The stem end of the base
is also somewhat different, being decorated by a rounded and finally a flat band.
This sherd carries a moderately heavy glaze and it is the first pipe form presented
which actually shows evidence of a salt glaze.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig22">Plate 22</a> AH.</i> Right Angle. Factory. One example. Color pale yellow to
light brown. Round bowl and base, double rounded band of beading around top
of bowl and stem end of base. Bowl decorated with raised dots in cross-hatched
pattern. Spiral decoration on base. Prominent mold marks, thin sidewalls. Heavily
glazed.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig22">Plate 22</a> AI.</i> Right Angle. Factory. Two examples. Color ranges from deep
red through light orange to yellow. This lighter pipe with thin sidewalls has
two narrow rounded bands encircling the top of bowl, which is otherwise plain.
A large rounded band is at stem end of base. These pipes are well glazed.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig23">Plate 23</a> AJ.</i> Right Angle. Factory. One example. Dark Red. This is a version
of the Company&rsquo;s novelty &ldquo;Tomahawk Pipe&rdquo;, decorated to order for special
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
occasions. The pipe illustrated was made specifically for sale at the Chicago
World&rsquo;s Fair and has &ldquo;Century of Progress, Chicago&rdquo; in raised letters on the left
side. &ldquo;1833&mdash;(likeness of an Indian)&mdash;1933&rdquo; is on the right side of bowl.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig23">Plate 23</a> AK.</i> Right Angle. Factory. One example. Color light tan. This was
the Company&rsquo;s standard novelty pipe, recommended for all occasions, and it was
shaped like a tomahawk. A likeness of Washington appears on the right side of
the bowl, with the name &ldquo;Washington&rdquo; in raised letters above. On the left side
is the likeness of an Indian wearing a Plains headdress, and above it in raised
letters is the name &ldquo;Powhatan&rdquo;. A wide flat band encircles the stem end of base.</p>
<p>The Pamplin Company&rsquo;s literature stated, <i>Tomahawk Pipe-Novelty, molded
from hand engraved brass die, of finest clay, hard-burned and glazed. An attractive
item for carnivals, conventions, fairs, etc. Packed 200 to a box with 5&Prime; reed stems. Price
$13.50 per box.</i> This pipe was a regular sales item for festive occasions (<a href="#fig11">Plate 11</a>).</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig23">Plate 23</a> AL.</i> Right Angle. (A surface find). One example. Deep red. Most
Pamplin pipes of home manufacture were made by women; however, Miss Wilsie
Thornton and Dr. C. G. O&rsquo;Brien said that a Mr. Rodgers, about 1938, made
pipe molds and pipes of unusual form as a hobby. Miss Thornton mentioned
two forms that he made&mdash;an Indian Head, and a Woman&rsquo;s Leg, the calf being
the bowl and the foot being the base, with the toes at the stem end of base.
This pipe is credited locally as being of his manufacture.</p>
<p><i><a href="#fig23">Plate 23</a> AM.</i> Right Angle. Home. Two examples. Deep glossy red. The
decoration on the lower portion of the round and expanding bowl reminds one
somewhat of a peach seed; this decoration is separated from the upper part of
the plain upper bowl by a rounded band. The base is undecorated, and terminates
in a smooth enlarged stem end. The second pipe of this form was a surface
find.</p>
<p>If the Factory had Nos. 103 and 117 how many more numbers may they
have had?</p>
<p>Impressed identifications, usually put on the base of the pipe with a stamp
after the pipe came from the mold, appear on pipes from both the Homes and
from the Factory. It is of interest that apparently identifications in raised lettering
came only from the Factory.</p>
<h3 id="c13">CONCLUSIONS</h3>
<p>In the beginning of this effort we had assumed that the pipes made by the
Factory would be quite different, in both form and decoration, from those made
in the homes. We have found that this assumption is not valid.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of overlapping, probably due to the Factory, after its
arrival in Pamplin, taking over and producing a number of the shapes and designs
that had long been in use in the Home Industry. It is also possible that
the Home Industry appropriated some of the Factory pipe forms.</p>
<p>In addition, all local evidence agrees that the Thornton Store did not purchase
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
pipes from the Factory; they were getting plenty themselves, taken in trade
for their merchandise, and which they would have to dispose of on the wholesale
market in competition with the Factory.</p>
<p>There is local evidence that the Factory did, at times, buy locally made pipes
in order to fill large orders, as well as when their machinery was not in operation.
It is quite unlikely however, after buying and paying for them, that these
pipes would be found in the landfill on the Factory grounds, the fill from which
the &ldquo;factory&rdquo; pipes considered in this study came.</p>
<p>Of the total of 39 pipe forms located by us, 10 were from Home Industry,
19 from the Factory, (eight appeared in both), and two were either surface finds
or the knowledge of their exact place of manufacture lost, as they had long
been in the hands of their local Pamplin area owners.</p>
<p>The Akron Company had made pipes before they established the pipe plant
at Pamplin, and the names of some of their pipes in the Pamplin literature
would infer that at least one form, the &ldquo;Akron Hamburg&rdquo;, had been carried
from Akron to Pamplin, which then is described as &ldquo;from Virginia clay, attractive
red color&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mrs. Betty Price has been quoted as saying that the
pipe form known as &ldquo;Hamburg&rdquo; was one of the first made by the women of the
area.</p>
<p>For a time in later years, at least by 1941, the Pamplin Factory made a pipe
similar in form and decoration to their &ldquo;Akron Hamburg&rdquo;, but of fire clay, and
called it &ldquo;Akron Shaker&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Since there is so much overlapping of form and decoration between the
pipes made in the homes and those made by the Company, one wonders if there
might not have been even more overlapping had the sample available to us at
this late date been greater than the 4,451 pipes examined.</p>
<p>It is our conclusion that when the Akron Company came to Pamplin they
started to produce pipes of a number of forms that had long been made by the
Home Industry of the Pamplin area. They may also have brought one or more
Akron pipe forms and decorations with them, to be manufactured at Pamplin.
In turn the Pamplin Home Industry possibly adopted some forms now being
produced by the Company. (Some of these forms may also have been in production
in other areas, but probably of different clay).</p>
<p>The foremost factor distinguishing Pamplin area pipes, from either manufacturing
source, was the &ldquo;Virginia clay, of attractive red color&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So far as we have been able to determine, no particular friction ever developed
between the Factory and the industry being carried on at the homes; each
had its own wholesale outlets.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, the Home Industry started about 1740 and
definitely closed in 1953.</p>
<p>The Pamplin Smoking Pipe and Manufacturing Company was established
about 1878, and it definitely closed in 1951.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>In our work we have handled literally hundreds of the pipes, <a href="#fig13">Plate 13</a> A,
called &ldquo;Powhatan Original&rdquo; in the Company&rsquo;s literature and advertising. These
had been excavated both from the factory grounds and from the basement of the
old Thornton Store, and we found nothing about these two lots of pipes that
would seem to distinguish the two manufacturing sources. Of the total, only
one single pipe failed to carry the word &ldquo;Original&rdquo; impressed in the base.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;Original&rdquo; was an early Home Industry form, and there is strong evidence
that when the Company came to Pamplin they adopted this form, and
added &ldquo;Powhatan&rdquo; in their advertising, just as they must have adopted some
other local pipe forms. &ldquo;Original&rdquo; was also impressed, but probably at a still
later date, on the base of three other pipe forms; they were forms &ldquo;B&rdquo;, &ldquo;M&rdquo;,
and &ldquo;AC&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We also believe that the Company made the best estimate as to the starting
date of the home pipemaking industry, (they would have had about a hundred
year advantage in arriving at such a date, as compared to the problem under
present circumstances), and applied that date to Pamplin Smoking Pipe and
Manufacturing Company as having been &ldquo;established 1739&rdquo;. In other words, they
pictured themselves as being a continuation of the industry that was already
there.</p>
<p>If the date of 1878, or one near that time, for the establishment of the Pamplin
Smoking Pipe and Manufacturing Co. is correct, then this is later than the
terminal date of some of the western forts and trading posts at which Pamplin
pipes have been reported. It would therefore seem evident that the Pamplin
pipes found in some western locations were the result of Home Industry, made
before the pipe plant ever got to Pamplin. This is authenticated by the fact that
they were being carried by the <i>Bertrand</i>.</p>
<p>It would seem desirable, instead of considering these pipes as Pamplin Company
products, to simply think of them as Pamplin Area Pipes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="ss"><span class="large">The Original Powhatan Pipe</span></span></p>
<p>The original Powhatan Indian hand-made Pipe has the distinction of
being the exact reproduction of the real pipe made and smoked by the Red
Men in pre-colonial days.</p>
<p>Pipe smoking was introduced into England by Sir Walter Raleigh
who had seen the Indians smoking. With the start of tobacco cultivation
in Virginia, the Powhatan Pipe became generally used in England and in
all of the American colonies.</p>
<p>A host of that day took great pride in offering his guests tobacco
grown on his own plantation, in a Powhatan Indian hand-made Pipe.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="ss"><span class="large">An Authentic American Treasure</span></span></p>
<p>The natives who have been making Powhatan Pipes for centuries are
rapidly disappearing. Their children seem unwilling to do the necessary
primitive and tedious work. Manual clay pipe-making, probably America&rsquo;s
oldest industry, will soon be only a tradition.</p>
<p>Today the Powhatan Pipe is more than a source of peaceful, contented
smoking enjoyment. It is a collector&rsquo;s prize, an authentic American
treasure. In a few years it will be generally unobtainable.</p>
<p>This company is the world&rsquo;s sole producer of genuine Indian pipes.
Since 1739 it has preserved this historic industry. Its clay deposit in
Appomattox County, Virginia, holds the only clay discovered as ideal for
Indian pipes. The trade-mark and name, &ldquo;Original Powhatan Indian
Pipe,&rdquo; is its exclusive property.</p>
<p>Yet the famous Powhatan Pipe is very low in price, as for many
years past, giving the consumer a splendid value, and the jobber and retailer
a profit unheard of in the tobacco trade.</p>

<br />Powhatan Pipe</span></i></span></p>
<hr />
<p>Made entirely by hand in a primitive
way, from hand-carved moulds several
centuries old, by natives in
Appomattox County, Va. Succeeding
generations, dating back to the
earliest days of America, have
practiced the ancient art of making
these Indian pipes by hand. The
slow, tedious work, requiring innate
skill, is not attractive to the moderns.
This art is rapidly disappearing.
Soon the genuine Powhatan Pipe
will be generally unobtainable. This
Pipe, therefore, will become a rare
and cherished antique and keepsake.</p>
<p>This Powhatan Pipe is an original,
made exactly like those the Indians
used prior to the coming of the white
man to America, and as smoked in
the early colonies and in England
following Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s introduction
of tobacco into that
country. The clay is porous and the
old Virginia reed stem also absorbs
the nicotine. To clean the pipe according
to the old Virginia method,
remove the stem and place the bowl
into the fire-place. This will burn
out the absorbed nicotine without
in any way harming the pipe. New
stems may be obtained from your
tobacconist.</p>

<p class="center">by
<br />Patricia J. O&rsquo;Brien and Kevin Hart</p>
<p>The Utlaut site (23SA162W) is located on the floodplain of the Missouri
River about one mile west of Malta Bend, Saline County, Missouri and approximately
two miles northwest of the junction of Highway 65 and 127.</p>
<p>The site is situated on land owned by Oscar John of Sweet Springs, Missouri
and was farmed by Ryland Utlaut of Grand Pass. Both kindly allowed us
to excavate there. We were directed to the site by J. M. &ldquo;Buster&rdquo; Crick of Corder,
Missouri, a local collector who had been finding ceramics which looked
&ldquo;Mississippian.&rdquo; His aid was invaluable, for without it this work could not have
been done.</p>
<p>Scattered occupational debris was found covering an area ca. 100 feet in
diameter around our test, but the major materials recovered, in six burials, seem
not to be related to the surface debris. Those materials will be reported in a
later paper dealing with site 23SA162, the Cole Lake Sand Ridge site.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the Utlaut site is situated on the floodplain of the river. The
area, though, is in reality an old beach of the Missouri, formed when the river
swung south of its present course and came near Grand Pass. Because the soil
was almost pure sand, all of it was screened.</p>
<p>The initial test was an east-west trench comprising five alternating squares
(<a href="#fig25">Fig. 2</a>). Burial materials were found between stakes 35W and 55W north and
south of the 0 line (<a href="#fig25">Fig. 2</a>). Remains of five burials were recovered. While a
few bones were treated as a separate burial in the field (Burial 5), they were found
to be related to Burial 2 on completion of the analysis. The bones in burials 1
through 5 were in very poor condition, and because of cultivation many are
missing.</p>
<h3 id="c16">BURIAL DESCRIPTIONS</h3>
<p>The osteological analysis of the skeletal remains found in <a href="#c19">Appendix I</a> is by
the junior author and Clark Larsen. The descriptions to follow will focus on the
cultural nature of the burials.</p>
<p><i>Burial 1.</i> This is an adult male. The body was extended and oriented on a
northeast-southwest axis with the head northeast. Although a vessel was found
in the same square as the burial, it is thought that it belongs to Burial 4. One
projectile point was found just east of the neck. Due north by about one foot
was a biface chopper/scraper. These artifacts may be associated with this burial
(Figs. <a href="#fig25">2</a> and <a href="#fig26">3</a>).</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 3. Burial 1, 23SA162W. View is toward northeast.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The projectile point is triangular, of tan-cream chert and is 3.1 cm. long,
1.44 cm. wide and 0.25 cm. thick (<a href="#fig27">Fig. 4</a>a). It is a typical Mississippian/Oneota
point. The biface was cream colored with cortex present. There is a scraper edge
on the long axis on one side (<a href="#fig27">Fig. 4</a>b). It is 14.0 cm. long, 9.9 cm. wide, and
3.1 cm. thick.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of this 35+ year old male burial is the
possible &ldquo;trophy&rdquo; skeletal materials placed on the knee area. Remains of three
persons and possibly a fourth were found in a fragmentary condition, and while
some of the long bones were intact, the cranial remains present were shattered.
Two explanations seem most obvious: (1) the remains are the result of some
type of human sacrifice, or (2) they are secondary burial of remains disturbed
from their original location. These ideas will be more fully explored later in the
paper.</p>
<p><i>Burial 2.</i> The skeletal material recovered from this burial was very fragmentary
and the actual number of individuals involved could be three rather than the two
suggested in the anatomical analysis. No complete skeleton was found, rather a
series of jumbled long bones with the femur head facing southwest (Figs. <a href="#fig25">2</a> and
<a href="#fig28">5</a>), suggesting an extended burial on a northeast-southwest axis. At the knee
area was found a skull which showed evidence of burning. This data, even more
than that of Burial 1, suggests &ldquo;human sacrifice&rdquo; or some such exotic behavior.
Because some of the long bones were burnt too, it is possible the firing occurred
as a part of the burial ritual. At the northeastern end of the burial was found a
child&rsquo;s skull; its relationship to the adult is unclear at this time.</p>
<p>Also associated with Burial 2 was a ceramic vessel and a fresh water mollusc
spoon (<a href="#fig29">Fig. 6</a>a-b). The spoon was very fragile and crumbled on cleaning. The
vessel was a small globular jar with an everted rim and two strap handles. On
the shoulder of the vessel below the handles were incised double nestled chevrons,
while two single incised lines ran vertically from neck to base between the
handles (<a href="#fig29">Fig. 6</a>a). The handles had double incised lines on them. The vessel was
shell tempered with a slight scalloping of the lip. It was 7.63 cm. high, the orifice
was 6.27 and 6.07 cm. in diameter, while the shoulder was 9.95 and 9.5 cm.
in diameter. The vessel seems to be a typical Oneota form.</p>
<p><i>Burial 3.</i> This burial was extended with head to the northeast and body on a
northeast-southwest axis (<a href="#fig30">Fig. 7</a>). It was a child&rsquo;s, and the only grave goods
associated with it was a chert scraper (<a href="#fig27">Fig. 4</a>c). It was found south of the pelvic
area. It is cream chert, is 3.39 cm. long, 1.78 cm. wide and 0.6 cm. thick. Anterioral
and posterioral flattening of the frontal and occipital region is marked on
this individual&rsquo;s skull.</p>
<p><i>Burial 4.</i> The burial when found was highly fragmentary; the legs are all that
remain. No artifacts were found with it. Alignment of the legs indicates that the
head was to the northeast and the body was on a northeast-southwest axis. However,
in the process of analyzing these data it was discovered that by projecting
the former location of the missing head and torso, this burial seems to be associated
with the isolated pot from square 0-40W. As figures <a href="#fig25">2</a> and <a href="#fig31">8</a> show, the
vessel would have been placed beside the left shoulder.</p>

<p>This oval-shaped vessel has 14 rows of punctations running around the
whole surface. There are two strap handles each with two incised lines placed
vertical to the rim (<a href="#fig29">Fig. 6</a>c-d). The rim has been damaged by the plow. Orifice
size is 8.21 cm. at the handles and 7.7 cm. between them. It is 12.36 by 13.2 cm.
at the shoulder and 8.15 cm. high (incomplete).</p>
<p>Vessels with similar extensive all-over punctation are reported from the
Lower Mississippi River Valley and called Parkin Punctated (Phillips, Ford and
Griffin 1951:Fig. 94). But a vessel with extensive punctation over the upper
two-thirds of it, with some zoned punctates in parallel lines below the handles,
has been reported from Gumbo Point (23SA4), an historic Missouri site about
a mile and a quarter to the northeast (Chapman 1959:Fig. 36).</p>
<p>Henning (1970) does not report such a design from the Utz site nor other
nearby Oneota sites. This tempts one to suggest the vessel has stronger affinities
to the historic Missouri than to the Oneota component nearby.</p>
<p><i>Burial 5.</i> These highly fragmentary remains probably belong with the child in
Burial 2. They were found in the northeast corner of square 5N-50W which is
just north of the area of the child&rsquo;s skull in Burial 2.</p>
<p><i>Burial 6.</i> This individual was interred in a different pattern from the others. It
was semi-flexed with the head and shoulders slumped forward and down as if
the burial pit was not large enough to hold him (Figs. <a href="#fig25">2</a> and <a href="#fig32">9</a>). Rodents had
run through the chest area and gnawed some of the bone.</p>
<p>Grave goods consisted of a whole vessel and glass trade beads. The vessel,
which was at his knee, was a globular jar having two strap handles with four
incised lines running vertically from the rim, and double nestled chevrons below
them. The chevron was filled with narrow-line, incised punctates (<a href="#fig33">Fig. 10</a>a-b).
The rim was damaged. The vessel is 10.5 by 11.7 cm. at the orifice, 16.3 by 18.0
cm. at the shoulder and 12.8 cm. high, making it slightly oval in shape.</p>
<p>Two kinds of beads were found. One was a &ldquo;seed&rdquo; bead <i>ca.</i> 0.18 cm. in
diameter with a 0.05 cm. hole. There were 202 of these found in the sand around
the head and shoulders. They may have been in the hair. All were turquoise in
color. The second kind included three larger specimens&mdash;two turquoise blue and
one black. The blue were 0.66 x 0.84 cm., 0.8 x 0.75 cm. and 0.82 x 0.63 cm. in
diameter and length. The first had a 0.2 cm. hole and the others 0.18 cm. The
black was 0.58 x 0.58 cm. with a 0.12 cm. hole. These beads were found in the
area of the left wrist.</p>
<p>These materials are historic trade goods, and are not significantly different
from those at Gumbo Point (Chapman 1959) or at the Utz site (Robert T. Bray,
personal communication). Although these materials could be the result of English
or even American trading activities, it is thought they are French, for the
following reasons.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>It is probable that this individual was a member of the Gumbo Point late
Missouri village which may date 1727-1777 A.D. (Chapman 1959:63). This village
was very near Fort Orleans which dates 1723-1728 A.D. (Bray 1961a:216-219).
At the same time, this burial is associated with others which have no trade
goods and apparently are completely prehistoric. Therefore, one could argue that
the body was interred at the time of the proto-historic-historic boundary for
that village. That boundary would be about 1727 A.D. if Chapman&rsquo;s (1959:2)
assumed dating of the beginning of the village following the abandonment of
the Utz site is correct.</p>
<p>However, it could be argued that Burial 6 had nothing to do with the
Oneota burials with it, and that the body could date as late as 1777 A.D. But
for that to be so, we would have to assume it was just chance that of the several
old beaches in that field this Indian was placed right in an earlier burial
area. Rather, it seems more reasonable to have the cemetery area known and
indeed the burials marked, so that the interment could take place without disturbing
them.</p>
<p>Whether the Missouri Indians marked their graves cannot be stated, as no
data on their mortuary practices are known. We do know that the Winnebago
placed a post at the head of a grave (Radin 1923:144), and as the Missouri and
Winnebago are both Chiwere Sioux, it is possible that this is an old shared trait.
If this is so, and if the 1727 A.D. dating is correct, the trade goods are probably
French as they were extremely active in this area at this early date.</p>
<h3 id="c17">DISCUSSION</h3>
<p>Two separate, but related, cultural components are present at the site: Oneota
and historic Missouri. Burials 1 through 4 were originally supine extended interments,
although they have suffered much from plowing, and their associated
artifacts indicate a general Oneota affiliation. Burial 4 with its punctated vessel
though is probably late, bordering on the late proto-historic-historic Missouri
line. Burial 6, with its glass trade beads, is historic, and since the Gumbo Point
site (23SA4), a historic Missouri village dating around 1727-1777 A.D., is only
one and a quarter miles to the northeast of the Utlaut site, the burial is probably
an Indian of that village.</p>
<p>The following data on Oneota burial practices can be extracted from these
data. Individuals are buried in a supine extended position on a northeast-southwest
axis. In three cases, Burials 1, 3 and 4, the head is to the northeast; in one,
Burial 2, it is southwest. Grave goods of pots, projectile point, shell spoon or
scraper were present but seemingly not very diagnostic of social position, although
the pots may be associated only with children here (Burials 2 and 4).
Also, unless one assumes everyone was buried at the same time, it seems that
the graves were marked so people could be interred over a period of time without
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
disturbing early graves, and so they could be aligned with each other.</p>
<p>Two adults seem to have &ldquo;trophy&rdquo; skeletal materials with them: a skull on
the knees of Burial 2 (burnt) and many fragments of three and possibly four
people on the lower legs of Burial 1. Bray (1961b:17-19) reports a &ldquo;trophy head&rdquo;
with an Orr focus Oneota burial at the Flynn site, and glass trade beads with it
point to this being an historic Ioway trait. Because there is no historic data on
Missouri Indian burial practices, it is not possible now to tell if the trait is associated
with them nor just what it may mean.</p>
<p>One could explain the skeletal remains, especially those with Burial 1 as
secondary interments of graves which were somehow disturbed. In which case
the term &ldquo;trophy&rdquo; would be inappropriate and misleading. This possibility is
found in the fact that the Winnebago had two burial patterns: inhumation and
platform associated with the phratry divisions of the culture, although the latter
practice died out in historic times (Radin 1923:140). Since the Missouri are related
to the Winnebago it is possible that these materials are inhumed platform
burials.</p>
<p>However, the presence of single skulls with Burial 2, burnt too, and with
an Ioway at the Flynn site cannot be explained that easily. The skull on the
knees of Burial 2 was burnt at the time of interment as the knee area was also
burned. Then too, if one was collecting platform burial remains to be inhumed,
more than just the skulls would be lying about to be collected. Again if we
look at the Winnebago we get some interesting data. In a discussion of grave-post
markings, Radin (1923:155) points out that a warrior who had killed a
man and cut off his head received a special grave-post signifying the deed. Unfortunately,
he does not tell us if the head was buried with him.</p>
<p>As can be seen by the above discussion, there are data to support both interpretations,
and indeed, maybe these burials in fact are the result of both sets
of behavior rather than only one set.</p>
<p>A comparison of the Utlaut site Oneota burials with other Oneota burial
data follows. From the Leary site in Nebraska Wedel reports (1935:25-26) two
types of interments: (1) supine burials with beads to the north (3), east (3) or
south (2). Associated with them are knives, hematite and a bison hoe as grave
goods. (2) Bundled or jumbled bones within a pit and probably removed from
scaffolds. Bass reports (1961) a body without head, semi-flexed on its back and
left side.</p>
<p>Myers and Bass (n.d.) give the following data on Oneota burial material
from Iowa. At the Hartley site (13AM103) in Allamakee County, Burial 1 was
primary extended with head west and face north. It was a child about ten years
old and with it was a pot and chert knife. Burial 2 was a female, 20-30 years old,
primary extended with head northeast and no artifacts. Burial 3 was a child, 10-13
years old with a pot. It was a secondary burial. Burial 4 was a female, 20-30
years of age, primary extended with head to the east. A bison scapula hoe was
with it. Burial 5 was a male, 25-35 years old; it was a primary one with the body
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
in a semi-sitting position and head on chest. The head faced northwest and the
face was down. No grave goods were present. Burial 7 was a secondary bundled
indeterminate adult. Burial 8 was a female, 18-28 years, primary extended burial
with head to the northwest and no artifacts. Burial 10 was a nine year old child,
primary extended with head to east. A pot was associated with it (Myers and
Bass n.d.:7-11).</p>
<p>At the Blood Run site (13L02) in Lyon county, five burials were reported
by Myers and Bass (n.d.). Burial 1 was a 3 to 4 year old child. It was extended
in a pit in a mound with head facing northwest. Associated were copper earrings,
two wooden tubes at the ears and a rim sherd at the right elbow. Burial 2 was
a 30-40 year old male, extended supine with head northwest and no artifacts.
Burial 3 was a 35-45 year old male, extended with head north and face to the
east. It may be burnt on the left side. Associated was a catlinite pipe and a shell
bead. Burial 4 was a male, 21-28 years of age, extended supine with head northeast
and no artifacts. Finally, Burial 5 was a 2-3 year old child, associated with
Burial 2; the grave goods were three blue glass beads (Myers and Bass n.d.:35-40).</p>
<p>At Correctionville site the burials are reported as extended supine (Myers
and Bass n.d.:43). At the Flynn site (13AM51) in Allamakee county ten burials
were recovered (Bray 1961b: 15-18). Burial 1 was a fully extended, supine adult
with head to north. Associated were a raven skull, two bone beads, two shell
beads, two copper or brass ornaments, a bone pendant and a small animal scapula.
Burial 2 was a fully extended supine adult with head north. Associated were
a pumice lump, red ochre, rolled copper or brass tubes, chert flakes and a belt
of rolled copper or brass beads. Burial 3 was a fully extended supine adult with
two triangular projectile points and some small animal bones. Burial 4 was a
fully extended supine adult oriented east-west. No trade goods were found; only
aboriginal bone whistles, a heron beak, a bone tube and a squirrel skull. Burial
5 was an adult oriented north-south and accompanied by many offerings: a pot,
a fresh water clam shell, 100 copper/brass beads, 12 copper/brass bracelets, sheet
copper, two steel knives, a steel awl, chert flakes, glass beads and &ldquo;bead&rdquo; girdle
as in Burial 1. Burial 6 was a fully extended supine adult with a north-south
orientation, with the head north. Artifact associations were blue and green glass
beads, a beaver incisor, chert flakes, a polished bison rib, a beaded girdle as with
Burials 1 and 5 and a &ldquo;trophy&rdquo; human skull at the left knee area. Burial 7 was
different because it was deeper, under slabs of rock, and in a pit. Present was a
child&rsquo;s skull and two carnivore jaws. Burials 8 and 9 were incomplete and damaged,
but seem to have been an adult and a 30-month old child. Burial 10 was a
fetus or newborn infant.</p>
<p>Ten burials are reported (Henning 1970:120-212) from the Utz site (23SA2),
the nearest large Oneota site just a few miles east of the Utlaut site. Position,
sex and age are known only for a few. Burial 3 was a 27 year old male, fully extended
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
with a mussel shell, sheet copper and bone tube. Burial 4 consisted of
two adults, but only one complete, fully extended 40 year old female. Burial 5
was a 30 year old male with a bone awl, a deer phalanx and worked hematite.
Burial 7 was a 35 year old male with knives and abrader. Burial 8 was fully extended,
35 years old, male, covered with red ochre and was accompanied by several
chert flakes. He may have died of wounds, since a projectile point was found
in the cervical vertebrae. Finally, in the summer of 1970 an adult male was found
in a storage/trash pit at the site (Robert T. Bray, personal communication).</p>
<p>Having reviewed the data on Oneota burials in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri,
the following hypotheses or assertions or guesses are offered concerning
the general character of Oneota mortuary practices. Hopefully they will be tested
in the future when more, especially descriptive, data become available.</p>
<p>(1) The bodies typically seem to be supine and fully extended.</p>
<p>(2) Orientation to a specific cardinal point does not seem to be involved as
they range all around the compass.</p>
<p>(3) There appears to be some evidence that the graves were marked.</p>
<p>(4) Although most burials have some grave goods material, some do not.
Except for the &ldquo;trophy&rdquo; material and the fact that some of the historic burials
have more artifacts, there do not seem to be marked differences in the wealth
of the burials. Possibly each individual is accompanied by some personal tool or
ornament. At the Flynn, Hartley and Utlaut sites, burials of children are accompanied
by ceramic vessels&mdash;at the Blood Run site, with a rim sherd. If this
is a pattern, it changed in historic times because burials with pots and trade
goods are adult (Flynn, B. 5, and Utlaut, B. 6).</p>
<p>(5) The lack of rich burials in the proto-historic (Oneota) period and their
presence in the historic suggests a process of social stratification may be occurring
because of new wealth. But this may be more apparent than real, if the
&ldquo;trophy&rdquo; material at the Utlaut site was the proto-historic means of marking
status to be replaced in the historic period by trade goods. If that is so, then it
would suggest some social stratification in Oneota continuing through to the
known historic Missouri chiefs.</p>

<br />SKELETAL REMAINS FROM THE UTLAUT SITE</h2>
<p class="center">by
<br />Kevin Hart and Clark Larsen</p>
<p>The following paper reports the osteological data on the burials from the
Utlaut site. The authors are indebted to Dr. William M. Bass, formerly of the
University of Kansas, now Chairman, Department of Anthropology, University
of Tennessee, for his encouragement and criticisms on this paper, and especially
for his training while Visiting Professor of Anthropology at Kansas State University
in the Spring, 1971. He is, of course, not responsible for any errors on
our part.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><i>Burial 1</i></dt>
<dd class="t3">Sex: Male</dd>
<dd class="t3">Age: 35&#8314;</dd>
<dd class="t3">Stature: 5&prime;8&Prime; &plusmn; 1.28&Prime; (173.46 cm &plusmn; 3.24 cm)</dd></dl>
<p>Burial One is a middle aged male in good condition, represented by an almost
complete skeleton. Of the major bones, only the left radius, right ulna and
left clavicle are absent, along with the second cervical, four thoracic and one
lumbar vertebra. Except for eight phalanges of the hand, all of the hand and
feet bones are also missing.</p>
<p>The sex of the individual is based on several factors. First, the width of the
femur head is 46 mm., within the male range according to Krogman (1962:143-146).
The skull is characterized by heavy brow ridges, blunt upper edges of the
eye orbits, and a general overall ruggedness indicating a male. The pelvis, however,
does have a wider than usual sciatic notch for a male.</p>
<p>Despite some erosion, the pubic symphyses show a breakdown of the symphyseal
rim and face indicating an age of 38&#8314; (McKern and Stewart:83). Endocranial
suture closure is complete, suggesting an approximate age of at least 40.
Thirdly, toothwear on the remaining molars seem to follow the pattern in Brothwell
(1963:69) for the 35-45 age group.</p>
<p>The Stature was calculated using the formula 1.22 (Femur and Tibia) +
70.37 &plusmn; 3.24 (Trotter and Gleser 1958:120).</p>
<p>Both the tibiae (<a href="#fig34">Fig. 11</a>) and fibulae show evidence of inflammation of the
Periosteum (Periostitis), similar to cases noted in Morse (1969:108). In addition,
one lumbar vertebra has an anomalous growth on it, and the chin of the individual
protrudes abnormally. The hole in the skull shown in the burial picture is the
result of an accident in the excavation.</p>

<p>Resting on and around the knees of Burial One were a number of whole
bones and bone fragments of at least three other individuals.</p>

<p>These bones were laid in a haphazard manner. Most of the larger post cranial
bones are represented by fragments from two separate individuals, but there are
parts of three left femora present and possibly four. The poor condition of the
fourth femur fragment left the side in doubt. The skull fragments are from at
least two different persons. Mixed in with these human bones are two tibia fragments
from a deer.</p>
<p>A skull fragment from one individual shows heavy muscle marking on the
occipital region, and a fairly large mastoid process, suggesting a male. There are
insufficient pieces of skull from the other individual or individuals for any judgment
on their sex. The pieces of innominate are also fragmentary, although it
appears that one acetabulum is rather large, possibly indicating a large femur
head. While the long bones from all the individuals seem large, all the femur
and humerus heads are missing, preventing any measurements for sex. All the
long bones are broken.</p>
<p>The age determination is based on the presence of completely closed endocranial
sutures on the skull fragments of two persons, suggesting a mature age.
Although suture closure is not a good criterion for age (McKern and Stewart
1957:37), a more accurate age estimate is not possible because of the absence of
pubic symphyses and teeth.</p>
<p>Stature could not be determined because of the broken condition of the long
bones.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Burial 2</i></p>
<p>There are at least two individuals represented in this burial.</p>
<table class="center">

<p>The adult bones associated with this burial included the upper portion of a
skull, right and left femur, right and left tibia, two fibula fragments, a first sacral
vertebra, and fragments of both the right and left innominates. The child is
represented by a left parietal. Several of the skull fragments as well as the right
femur and sacral vertebra of the adult showed evidence of burning. Most of the
skeletal material is fragmentary and in poor condition.</p>
<p>The age of the adult is based on cranial suture closure. The sutures endocranially
are closing, but ectocranially the sutures are still quite distinctive and
have not yet begun to close. This indicates an age of 28 to 35 years. However,
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
some authorities feel this is not a good criterion for aging (McKern and Stewart
1957:37).</p>
<p>The sex is based on morphological characteristics of the cranial material.
The skull contained large frontal sinuses and heavy muscle markings, indicative
of the male sex (Krogman 1962:112-152).</p>
<p>Stature was based on the formula for Mongoloids given by Trotter and
Gleser (1958:120) for the femur plus the tibia. Using the left femur plus the
tibia the stature estimation was calculated to be 5&prime;9.3&Prime; with a range from 5&prime;8&Prime;
to 5&prime;10.6&Prime; (175.9 cm &plusmn; 3.24 cm). This stature is also indicative of the male sex.</p>
<p>Age of the child is determined by the thickness and size of the left parietal.
This indicated an age of probably not younger than three and not older than six.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><i>Burial 3</i></dt>
<dd class="t3">Age: 10-12</dd></dl>
<p>This child&rsquo;s burial consisted of the major portion of an articulated skull, a
mandible, a left scapula, right and left tibia, right and left femur, right and left
innominates, two rib fragments, and two lumbar vertebrae. The condition of this
burial is poor with all the bones being in various stages of fragmentation.</p>
<p>The age of this individual is based on tooth eruption and wear. The adult
second molars are fully erupted and show no wear. The adult second premolars
are in the process of erupting, indicating an age of 10-12 (Brothwell 1963:59).</p>
<p>Skull deformation is quite noticeable. It is flattened both anteriorly and
posteriorly, particularly in the frontal and occipital regions. This deformation is
probably due to pressure applied to the head of the infant through binding to a
flat structure, such as a cradle board (<a href="#fig35">Fig. 12</a>).</p>
<p>All mandibular teeth are present with no caries or tartar. The adult second
premolars are quite late in erupting. As previously indicated the skull is mostly
articulated, but is in poor condition. Parts of the frontal and occipital are missing.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><i>Burial 4</i></dt>
<dd class="t3">Sex: Indeterminate</dd>
<dd class="t3">Age: Child</dd>
<dd class="t3">Stature: Indeterminate</dd></dl>
<p>Burial four is the remains of one individual: a child, in poor condition. The
remaining bones are fragments from the right femur, tibia and fibula, and from
the left tibia. In addition, there were also several unidentifiable pieces. The size
and condition of the fragments make any specific judgment as to sex, age, or
stature impossible other than to say the individual was rather young. No anomalies
or pathologies were evident.</p>

<dd class="t3">Age: 19-25</dd>
<dd class="t3">Sex: Male</dd>
<dd class="t3">Stature: 5&prime;8.6&Prime; &plusmn; 1.3&Prime; (174.2 cm &plusmn; 3.24 cm)</dd></dl>
<p>Most of the bones of this burial are present with the exception of the majority
of the hand phalanges, carpal and tarsal bones, one lumbar vertebra, and
the coccygeal vertebrae. The condition of the bones is fair.</p>
<p>The age of this individual is based on the fact that the basilar suture has
just closed and the sacral vertebrae have not completely fused. The sutures have
not yet begun to close, and all of the epiphyses of the long boxes have united,
suggesting an age range of 19 to 25.</p>
<p>Sex determination is based on morphological and anthropometric characteristics
of both the post-cranial and cranial skeleton. The diameter of the femur
head is 46 mm, well within the male range (Krogman 1962:143-146). The innominates
showed narrow pubic portions and sub-pubic angles. The skull has
distinctive muscle markings, large mastoid processes, heavy brow ridges, and a
square chin, all of which are characteristically male.</p>
<p>The stature estimation was calculated from the length of the left femur and
tibia, using Trotter and Gleser&rsquo;s formula for Mongoloids (Trotter and Gleser
1958:120). It was calculated to be 5&prime;8.6&Prime; with a range from 5&prime;7.3&Prime; to 5&prime;9.9&Prime; (1.74
cm &plusmn; 3.24 cm). As indicated in <a href="#table4">Table 2</a>, this individual was hyperbrachycranic
or very broad headed. As in Burial 3, lambdoidal flattening was quite noticeable,
probably a result of pressure of a cradle board.</p>
<p>Due to the poor condition of the material from the Utlaut site, anatomical
comparisons other than male stature are not possible. <a href="#table5">Table 3</a> gives the stature
comparisons of the Iowa-Nebraska Oneota material, and they suggest that for
height of males, the Utlaut population are most similar to the males at the Leary
site in Nebraska.</p>

<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">A REPORT OF SALVAGE INVESTIGATIONS AT ST. CHARLES, MISSOURI</span></h2>
<p class="center">by J. M. Shippee</p>
<p>In the latter part of August 1956, Mr. Andrew H. McCulloch of St. Charles,
Missouri addressed a letter to the Department of Anthropology, University of
Missouri, in which he told of the discovery of buried remains which were thought
to be of Indian origin. Road construction in a new housing area just north of St.
Charles, Missouri had exposed an Indian camp site on high ground overlooking
the Missouri-Mississippi River flood plain. Mr. McCulloch had been informed
by the land owner, Mr. J. D. Wright, that a portion of a grave had been opened,
exposing bones of humans and animals and broken pottery vessels.</p>
<p>The letter was delivered to Carl H. Chapman, then Director of American
Archaeology at the university, who visited the site and decided that further investigations
were advisable. Professor Chapman directed the writer to make
limited investigations at the site. This work was done in 3 days beginning September
1, with the very capable assistance of Leonard Blake and Winton Meyer
of St. Louis, and Robert Wright of St. Charles.</p>
<p>The new road cut which exposed the remains is located at the eastern edge
of an old field, which has an elevation of 90 feet above the river flood plain.
Erosion had removed much of the dark topsoil from above the light colored
loess, which apparently is very deep. At five locations in the road cut, dark deposits
of cultural debris were observed in clearly defined pits which had been
cross-sectioned by the grading machines. These pits were grouped at the deeper
excavations for the road which were approximately 500 feet apart. At several
places, in loose earth along the road, Indian artifacts were found where the grading
operations had deposited them; their exact provenience is therefore, doubtful.</p>
<p>Pits <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> were at the north end of the field and were exposed in the vertical
bank at the east side of the new road. Both had been gouged by curious
persons, and nothing is known of the material removed prior to the work described
here.</p>
<p>Pit <i>A</i> could be clearly defined in outline beneath 28 inches of overburden.
This overburden consisted of 4 inches of top soil and 24 inches of light colored
soil. The pit outlined by the cultural fill measured 8 inches deep, and had been
approximately 40 inches in diameter. Excavation later revealed that the deposit
extended only 13 inches into the bank, the greater part of the deposit having
been previously removed. The sterile overburden was examined as it was removed
from above the pit. The pit fill was so compact that Blake had difficulty
in examining it. The deposit contained 3 rimsherds (<a href="#fig36">Fig. 1</a>) and 31 bodysherds
in the upper part, and considerable bone scrap of animals in the lower. A trace
of burned clay and a few small lumps of fired limestone were scattered in the
fill. Charred wood was collected for radiocarbon dating, and according to Dr.
J. B. Griffin of the University of Michigan and Professor H. R. Crane, University
of Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Radiocarbon Laboratory, it was found to be
dated (M-619)&mdash;1240&plusmn;200 years before present, which would give the date before
1950 as A.D. 710&plusmn;200. Also found in the pit were a few flint flakes and
one crude flint blank. The bones in pit <i>A</i> were thought to be from game animals
and consisted of 5 mandibles and 2 long bones. A large mandible, from which
all the teeth had been removed by pot-hunters, is thought to be that of a bison.
Three mandibles were from deer.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>The potsherds from pit <i>A</i> are from large vessels, and with one exception
they have lightly re-smoothed cordmarked exteriors. All sherds have been
smoothed inside. Of the three rimsherds recovered, two have rounded lips and
one a rather flat lip which, in the process of smoothing, received considerable
more burring over the outer edge than those with the rounded lip. All sherds
are hard and clay tempered. The color of these sherds is a muddy-brown or
brownish-grey. An exceptional sherd from pit <i>A</i> is tan in color, clay tempered
except for a few particles of grit, has a smooth interior and is decorated on the
outer surface with roulette or dentate stamping (<a href="#fig36">Fig. 1</a>, d).</p>
<p>Pit <i>B</i>, located 33 feet south of pit <i>A</i> in the same east bank was similar, but
only a small remnant of it remained after the usual vandalism. This pit was beneath
24 inches of overburden; it had a concentration of cultural fill that measured
6 inches in depth and the diameter had been approximately 30 inches. Small
lumps of fired limestone were scattered through the fill, which included two rimsherds
(<a href="#fig37">Fig. 2</a>, a and b) and 12 small body sherds. One rimsherd is evidently
from a miniature pot. It is smooth inside and out, grey in color, very hard and
without apparent tempering material. The other rimsherd is similar to those
from pit <i>A</i> which have the rounded lips. The body sherds seem to be from
rather large vessels which had cordmarked exterior surfaces and are clay tempered
except for one which was tempered with grit. One flake of white chert
showed usage.</p>
<p>Pit <i>C</i> was a small, poorly defined deposit of material foreign to the light
colored soil about it. The top of the deposit was 15 inches below the present
surface of the field. Three large cordmarked sherds and a number of small ones
were excavated. There were also bits of burned clay and a few flint chips. Nearby,
in the disturbed earth of the road, several large, grit tempered and cordmarked
sherds were recovered.</p>
<p>Pit <i>D</i> was exposed partly in the west bank of the road at its southern end.
In addition to the part of the pit exposed in the cutbank, the horizontal outline
of the pit could be traced on the surface of the graded road. Approximately half
the contents of the pit had been graded away. This pit, which excavation revealed
to be 20 inches deep, as marked by the dark fill, was covered by 18 inches
of light colored soil. The sides belled considerably and the flat, oval bottom
measured 4 feet northwest to southeast by 5 feet northeast to southwest.</p>

<p>Over 150 potsherds were recovered; 17 were rims of vessels, nine are
sketched in <a href="#fig38">Figure 3</a>. With few exceptions, these rims were similar to those from
pits <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> and are from large vessels. They were cordmarked, very hard, and
are tempered with clay and some grit. Many sherds break squarely, others flake
badly and even crumble. From these potsherds, one vessel has been restored sufficiently
to give its characteristics (<a href="#fig39">Fig. 4</a>). The pot, of about 3 quarts capacity, is
8 inches high, 8 inches at its greatest diameter and is rather thin walled. It has
dark grey paste, is clay tempered, very hard and has fine vertical cordmarks over
the upper body with cordmarks at random below the shoulder. The smooth
interior has small angular impressions or punctates inside the lip, which is slightly
everted. This vessel, considerably different from the others at the site, is very
similar to one from Arnold-Research Cave which is 70 miles west in Callaway
County, Missouri (Shippee, 1966). The pot from the cave was shell tempered.
In a personal communication of April 13, 1959, Dr. James B. Griffin states that
in theory the pottery from this site can be compared to that from sites where
Canteen grit tempered cordmarked and perhaps Korando clay tempered cordmarked
material is recovered. Of the many sherds recovered from pit <i>D</i>, all are
cordmarked or brushed. One sherd is from a vessel with a thick conical base.</p>
<p>A baked clay object from pit <i>D</i> seems to be a section of a small ring (<a href="#fig37">Fig. 2</a>).
One unperforated disc of cordmarked pottery was found (<a href="#fig37">Fig. 2</a>). Three projectile
points were found (<a href="#fig37">Fig. 2</a>). These points were made from flakes struck
from cores. Two have only primary chipping around the perimeter; the third
has secondary chipping on one edge. Two of the points were made from a pale
pink chalcedony. Of the small number of flint flakes found, few show evidence
of use, but one had been modified to form a drill (<a href="#fig37">Fig. 2</a>). The perforated canine
of a dog or wolf was in the fill of this pit (<a href="#fig37">Fig. 2</a>). Two antler sections have
been altered; one by a cut which removed the tine and the other by cutting or
scraping to thin it. Bone scrap of fish and animals, mussel shells and burned
limestone fragments occurred in pit <i>D</i>. Of the considerable charcoal recovered
from pit <i>D</i>, a sample sent to Michigan was dated (M-620) at 930&plusmn;100 years
B.P. or A.D. 1020&plusmn;100 before 1950. The wood was from a white ash group, a
red oak group and hickory. Identification by R. Yarnell Nov. 21, 1962. Reported
by letter from George J. Armelagos Jan. 28, 1963.</p>
<p>Pit <i>E</i> contained one rimsherd similar to those numerous on the site, and 14
body sherds, one of which was from a large vessel having a conoidal base. Three
sherds were from a miniature pot. Pit <i>E</i> was 24 feet south of pit <i>D</i> and on the
same west road bank. It could be defined below 19 inches of light colored overburden
and had a depth of 8 inches. A radiocarbon date for charcoal from pit <i>E</i>
is (M-621)&mdash;1180&plusmn;100 B.P. or A.D. 770&plusmn;100 before 1950. The charcoal was
from red oak and white oak groups, as identified by Richard Yarnell at the University
of Michigan.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>From the surface of the road there was collected three rimsherds, 20 body
sherds, bone scrap, and a hammerstone which had a pit in two of its flat faces.
Artifacts are reported to have been found on the surface of the field surrounding
this hilltop site, but we found scant evidence of occupation in the plowed soil.
This lack of surface material may be further evidence of considerable deposition
over the pits that were exposed in the roadway across the site.</p>
<p>Leonard Blake sent a copy of the original manuscript of this excavation to
Patrick J. Munson of the Department of Anthropology, University of Illinois,
and Mr. Munson kindly submitted comparisons and comments on the 23SC50
and Late Woodland ceramics in the American Bottoms. The following is from
his letter of June 15, 1966.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pottery shows similarities to both Korondo Cordmarked and what I
call &ldquo;Early Bluff&rdquo; (which includes part of what Griffin calls Canteen Cordmarked
and which conforms to part of Titterington&rsquo;s Jersey Bluff focus). Korondo and
Early Bluff are definitely related in some way (probably regional variants of what
is basically the same cultural pattern) and your material therefore represents
still another variant of this same pattern.</p>
<p>The comparisons and contrasts can best be illuminated in the following
table:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr class="th"><th> </th><th>Korondo </th><th>Early Bluff </th><th>St. Charles</th></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Vessel Shape </td><td class="c">x </td><td class="c">x </td><td class="c">x</td></tr>

</table>
<p>As such, your material seems about as similar to one as the other, every attribute
being shared with either Korondo or Early Bluff, or with both.</p>
<p>Also your radiocarbon dates, or at least the two earliest ones, conform quite
well. Dr. Robert Hall, now of the University of Chicago, has two dates for a
Korondo site in the southern part of the American Bottoms (Stolle Quarry)
AD-700 and 900, and by a process of elimination, Early Bluff in the northern
portion of the Bottoms must date pre-850. (Korondo is found in the southern
part of the Bottoms and south; Early Bluff is in the northern portion and north.)
Your one dentate stamped sherd (<a href="#fig36">Fig. 1</a>) is probably Naples Dentate Stamped,
and as such is surely an accidental inclusion&mdash;I doubt if this Middle Woodland
type was made later than A.D. 400 at the latest. Also the largest projectile point
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
from pit <i>D</i> looks like a sloppy Snyders Point, again a Middle Woodland type
and probably an accident (or a specimen collected by the Late Woodland peoples).
The smallest point from the pit is probably a Late Woodland Koster
Point (cf. Perino, 1963, Central States Arch. Jour., Vol. 10, No. 3, pp. 95-100).</p>
<p>An attribute you might include in your pottery description is the direction
of twist of cords used in making the cordmarkings; &ldquo;S&rdquo; twist (right hand) and
&ldquo;Z&rdquo; twist (left hand)&mdash;but remember, the impressions on the pottery are negative,
so the <i>cord was the opposite of the impressions that you see</i>. I found the percentage
of this attribute quite significant in separating Early Bluff from Late Bluff.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c21">CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>The three days of salvage archaeology at this site at St. Charles, Missouri
were well rewarded by the information gained and especially by the recovery of
charcoal associated with the artifacts in the pits. The three radiocarbon dates,
with the exception of the late one, must be of considerable value to archaeologists
investigating sites in the Midwest, and especially those in the vicinity of
St. Louis and the American Bottoms. As for the site, the writer understands that
it is totally built over, but isolated finds during construction work at the location
could provide further important knowledge of the prehistoric Indians who
inhabited the site. The passage of 16 years since the initial investigation, before
this report could be concluded, is further proof that the archaeologist&rsquo;s job is a
difficult one to pursue, and it is only by the persistent endeavor and cooperation
of the various persons interested that anything is accomplished.</p>
